<p>Adam, eight, was shot in the head as he ran away from Israeli armoured vehicles. Basil, 15, and eight-year-old Adam lay dead from gunshots fired by Israeli soldiers. The BBC has pieced together what happened on the day the two boys were killed. Ben Saul, UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, says the death of Adam appears to be a "war crime" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the circumstances of the deaths were ‘under review’ but said “live fire is used only in order to remove immediate threats or for arrest purposes, following arrest protocols after exhausting other options”. Palestinian homes being vandalised with graffiti, Palestinian civilians threatened with weapons and told to leave the territory for neighbouring Jordan.

<p>When Dua Lipa headlines Glastonbury this June, it will be her first appearance at Worthy Farm since playing the cramped John Peel stage in 2017. “I was doing all sorts of crazy stuff and when I got off stage, I could barely walk,” she admitted. Despite the pain, she was ecstatic. The gig felt like "a massive step up’ The star has sold 1.5 million copies of her two albums in the UK alone. Her first hit, New Rules, clocked up its three-billionth play on YouTube this January. It's a record that sees her navigating life after a major break-up, and establishing new New rules to break a pattern of dating wrong ‘uns. She says she has learned to not kid herself: "I've learned not to kid myself" She also wants to turn this year's festival into a nightclub, with a bar and a dancefloor. But as she sat down to talk to the BBC she winced, saying she'd mashed her tailbone. "It was an aggravation of an old injury, caused by the whiplash intensity of my dancing," she said.</p>

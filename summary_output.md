They are concerned about the overuse of AI as a buzzword, without firms explaining exactly how their AI supposedly works. It is hoped that the AI system will be able to glean insights from multiple sensors and crunching millions of data points to create the perfect crop.

Some leading Republicans including former President Donald Trump and former Arizona Governor Doug Ducey distanced themselves from the law, suggesting it was out of step with the state's voters.

MPs approve the second reading of the controversial "foreign agent" bill. The EU warns it could harm Tbilisi's ambitions of joining the bloc. Opponents say the measures are inspired by authoritarian legislation that neighbouring Russia uses to crush dissent. Protesters fear that the proposed foreign influence bill could be used to crush critical voices ahead of the parliamentary elections later this year. A similar authoritarian law that came into force in Russia in 2012 has since been used to marginalise voices challenging the Kremlin.
